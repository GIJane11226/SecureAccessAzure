# Secure Access with Azure Active Directory
## Description
Configured and managed Azure Active Directory (AD) to enhance identity and access management (IAM) security. Implemented security policies to protect user accounts and control access to cloud-based applications.
## Technologies Used
Microsoft Azure, Azure Active Directory (AD), Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA), Role-Based Access Control (RBAC), Single Sign-On (SSO), Conditional Access Policies.
## Outcome/Skills Gained
Developed hands-on experience in cloud security, identity protection, and access management by implementing secure authentication mechanisms within Microsoft Azure AD. Strengthened knowledge in zero trust security models, least privilege access, and compliance with security frameworks such as NIST and ISO 27001.
## Quantify Results
Successfully applied Multi-Factor Authentication and conditional access policies to improve authentication security, ensuring 100% compliance with best practices for secure access management.
